         http://regex101.com/ is a great place to test if the regex works -->

    <!-- If the developer of the zip file doesn't like to use consistent names,
         multiple regexes can be used -->

    <!-- Boot images are detected automatically by default. The patcher will
         look for all files ending in ".img" or ".lok" and read their headers
         to make sure they really are boot images. If any boot images are
         missed, they can be manually specified here. -->
